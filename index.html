                            Yoga is an accessible practice that can be adjusted to suit your individual needs and is suitable for anyone who is
                            interested.
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            There are supportive yoga mats available for use by anyone joining a class, along with yoga blocks, belts and other
                            props that can make the physical practice more comfortable and attainable. All of the postures, or yoga asana, will
                            be demonstrated and clearly explained verbally with verbal adjustments provided throughout the class. Physical
                            adjustments can be given to students who want them and will not be given to students who do not want them. If you
                            have a disability, illness or injury that you think might limit your access to a group yoga class; get in touch,
                            there are options in yoga for everyone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can wear whatever clothing you want to the classes, though comfortable and non-restrictive clothing is
                            recommended. Shoes may not be worn during the class and shoes should not touch the yoga mats, to keep the mats clean
                            and in good condition. Students are welcome to bring small blankets, cushions, cozy jumpers, fluffy socks or even
                            eye masks for the closing savasana (the final moments of the class involves stillness, relaxation and winding down,
                            so bring whatever you think will help you feel snug) Book a class now
