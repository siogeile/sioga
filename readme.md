## Design

### Colour Scheme

I used light to dark lavender-purples and greys to envoke a fresh feeling of gentle calm and because of it's psychological ties to growth and healing. For highlights I chose a bright invigorating green to energise while still promoting a sense of calm.

Though irrelevant today, I thought it would be interesting to limit myself to "websafe" hex colours to see if I could still create a palette that worked well. After chosing websafe alternatives, I decided I liked how the new colours interacted and decided to keep the adjustments.

#### Colour Accessibility

I used the [contrast checker tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) by [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) to ensure my site did not cause eye strain and that it met the highest level of Web Content Accessibility Guidlines and only used combinatins of colours that passed entirely, or amending the hex code if needed.

### Typography

I chose [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa) for general text and [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu) for headings, and imported both from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Both fonts are sans-serif and easy to read on-screen.

I wanted to use a font that had some small hint of how sanskrit script looks, but maintained strong web readability and felt crisp and contemporary. I found similarities in Ubuntu to handwritten sanskrit script such as the abrupt yet soft curves, and the slender yet somehow stocky visual created by the characters. I paired Comfortaa as a subtle contrast to add a lightness and softness that still captures a similar feeling.

### Imagery

Planned imagery used through site

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

## Features

What pages your site is made up of, features included eg navbar etc...

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

Screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site?

### Accessibility

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

### README

I used a README [template](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples/blob/main/milestone1-readme.md) developed by [kera-cudmore](https://github.com/kera-cudmore) to form the base of this README. All headings, sections and the index are following that template unless mentioned otherwise. The content filling the README is my own, unless mentioned otherwise.

I used the headings for my "User Stories" section from the README of another [project](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#bully-book-club-website) by [kera-cudmore](https://github.com/kera-cudmore).
