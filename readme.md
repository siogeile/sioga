## Features

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site?

### Accessibility

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

###  Media

### README

I used a README [template](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples/blob/main/milestone1-readme.md) developed by [kera-cudmore](https://github.com/kera-cudmore) to form the base of this README. All headings, sections and the index are following that template unless mentioned otherwise. The content filling the README is my own, unless mentioned otherwise.

I used the headings for my "User Stories" section from the README of another [project](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#bully-book-club-website) by [kera-cudmore](https://github.com/kera-cudmore).
