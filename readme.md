# sióga

sioga is a website for learning yoga and meditation techniques."Sióga" is an Irish word meaning "elf" or "fairy", and the *ióga* part of the word is phonetically similar to *yoga*. Sióg is also the name of the teacher, who brings their Irish culture into their classes through speaking words *as gaeilge*, chanting with Irish blessings and keeping an understanding of the particular struggles, culture, (humour), and strengths experienced by those living in Ireland due to the unique history of the Island.

Sióg believes yoga is a powerful tool for healing and growth, but also recognises that it can be inaccessible. Sióga aims to help yogis from any background and of any experience level feel like they can find benefit out of a yoga practice regardless of financial situation, class, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability or location.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I used light to dark lavender-purples and greys to envoke a fresh feeling of gentle calm and because of it's psychological ties to growth and healing. For highlights I chose a bright invigorating green to energise while still promoting a sense of calm.

Though irrelevant today, I thought it would be interesting to limit myself to "websafe" hex colours to see if I could still create a palette that worked well. After chosing websafe alternatives, I decided I liked how the new colours interacted and decided to keep the adjustments.

#### Colour Accessibility

I used the [contrast checker tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) by [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) to ensure my site did not cause eye strain and that it met the highest level of Web Content Accessibility Guidlines and only used combinatins of colours that passed entirely, or amending the hex code if needed.

### Typography

I chose [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa) for general text and [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu) for headings, and imported both from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Both fonts are sans-serif and easy to read on-screen.

I wanted to use a font that had some small hint of how sanskrit script looks, but maintained strong web readability and felt crisp and contemporary. I found similarities in Ubuntu to handwritten sanskrit script such as the abrupt yet soft curves, and the slender yet somehow stocky visual created by the characters. I paired Comfortaa as a subtle contrast to add a lightness and softness that still captures a similar feeling.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### General features on each page

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all four pages, the fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page (from the logo), the "About" section, a sign up and contact page. It is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.

  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

  - The links to the other pages will be hidden in a dropdown menu on the right when the site is being viewed on mobile and smaller devices and they will be shown in a horizontal list when viewed on desktop and large devices.

- __The Footer__

  - The footer includes links to the relevant social media sites for sióga which open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.

  - The footer is valuable to the user because it gives them multiple ways to interact, follow and stay connected with sióga.

- __Favicon__

  - Add information about favicon here.

- __Hero Images__

  -  Each page has a calming hero image that envokes a feeling that suits the content of the page. The landing page includes a photograph of Sióg with text overlay to allow the user to see exactly which location this site would be applicable to. This introduces the user to Sióg and sets up the foundational sense of calm that will be carried throughout the site.

  - The about page features a photograph of a butterfly resting on a human hand - symbolising trust, unity, surrender and new beginnings.

  - The sign-up page features a hero image of a singing bowl, a tool used to gently bring attention to something.

  - The contact page features a hero image of a winding road, or a path, representing the decision to move forward, reach out.

#### Page specific features

- __Is yoga for me infographic__

  - A visual section on the landing page that answers questions with clarity and shows the user the benefits of yoga.

  - The user will see the value of sioga classes and encourage them to encorporate yoga into their daily routine.

- __Unordered List__

  - An ordered list that tells the user what is on offer on the about page.

- __Table__

  - A timetable that gives adequate and clear information regarding the schedule of classes, also on the about page.

- __Sign Up Form__

  - A sign up form that includes an input box for the users name and email with validation and a submit button.

- __Contact Box__

  - A text section containing contact information for site visitors

### Future Implementations

- A thank you page the user is redirected to upon sign-up

- A 404 Page

- A contact form that allows users to write a message directly into the site rather than leaving to visit other social media pages or their email account

### Accessibility

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

### README

I used a README [template](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/readme-examples/blob/main/milestone1-readme.md) developed by [kera-cudmore](https://github.com/kera-cudmore) to form the base of this README. All headings, sections and the index are following that template unless mentioned otherwise. The content filling the README is my own, unless mentioned otherwise.

I used the headings for my "User Stories" section from the README of another [project](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#bully-book-club-website) by [kera-cudmore](https://github.com/kera-cudmore).

I used the "Love Running" README to populate my features section with edits to make it my own.

For my first pen and paper wireframes I blocked out the "Coding Club" Sample Project from the Code Institute coursework and populated it with content for my project in order to get a feel for building wireframes.
